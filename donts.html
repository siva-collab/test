            <li >Don't expose a cold clay pot to sudden high heat, as this can cause it to crack.</li>
            <li>Don't use metal utensils, as they can scratch or damage the surface of the clay pot.</li>
            <li>Don't use your clay pot on direct heat sources such as an open flame or stovetop burner without a diffuser, as this can lead to uneven heating and potentially cause the pot to crack.</li>
            <li>Don't use soap or detergent to clean your clay pot, as it can absorb into the porous surface and affect the flavor of future dishes.</li>
            <li>Don't store food in your clay pot for extended periods of time, as the porous nature of the clay can lead to bacteria growth.</li>
            <li>Don't subject your clay pot to extreme temperature changes, such as transferring it directly from the refrigerator to a hot oven, as this can cause it to crack.</li>
            <li>Don't use a damaged clay pot for cooking, as it may leach harmful substances into your food.</li>
            <li>Don't stack heavy items on top of your clay pot during storage, as this can cause it to crack or break.</li>
